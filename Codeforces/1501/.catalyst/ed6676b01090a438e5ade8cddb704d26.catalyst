In order to make her trip more entertaining, one of Nastya&apos;s friend presented her an integer array $$$a$$$. </p><p>Several hours after starting her journey home Nastya remembered about the present. To entertain herself she decided to check, are there four <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">different</span> indices $$$x, y, z, w$$$ such that $$$a_x + a_y = a_z + a_w$$$.</p><p>Her train has already arrived the destination, but she still hasn&apos;t found the answer.
