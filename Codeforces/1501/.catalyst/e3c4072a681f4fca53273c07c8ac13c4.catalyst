But then he remembered that one can&apos;t make a problem about stacking pancakes without working at a specific IT company, so he decided to bake the Napoleon cake instead.</p><p>To bake a Napoleon cake, one has to bake $$$n$$$ dry layers first, and then put them on each other in one stack, adding some cream. Arkady started with an empty plate, and performed the following steps $$$n$$$ times: </p><ul> <li> place a new cake layer on the top of the stack; </li><li> after the $$$i$$$-th layer is placed, pour $$$a_i$$$ units of cream on top of the stack. </li></ul><p></p><p>When $$$x$$$ units of cream are poured on the top of the stack, top $$$x$$$ layers of the cake get drenched in the cream. If there are less than $$$x$$$ layers, all layers get drenched and the rest of the cream is wasted. If $$$x = 0$$$, no layer gets drenched.</p><p></p><center> <img class=\"tex-graphics\" height=\"75px\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/45fb6f7967c5e2a07c667a087c2b9602e4fd8373.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\" width=\"567px\"> <span class=\"tex-font-size-small\">The picture represents the first test case of the example.</span> </center><p></p><p>Help Arkady determine which layers of the cake eventually get drenched when the process is over, and which don&apos;t.</p>","inSpecsHtml":"<div class=\"section-title\">Input</div><p>Each test contains multiple test cases.
